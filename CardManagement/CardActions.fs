namespace CardManagement

(*
This module contains business logic only. It doesn't know anything about data access layer,
it doesn't deal with composition, the only thing we have here is functions, which represent
business data transformations.
Note that all the functions here are pure and total: they don't deal with any kind of external state,
they have no side effects, and they can successfully process ANY kind of input - they don't throw exceptions.
Since they deal with domain types (which earlier we designed in a way that invalid data can't be represented with them),
we don't need to do input validation here. The only error we return in here is `OperationNotAllowedError`,
which means that user provided valid data but wants to do something that is not allowed, e.g. pay with expired card.

            We could use here the ultimate wild card case like this:
            | _ ->
            but it's dangerous because if a new case appears in `DailyLimit` type,
            we won't get a compile error here, which would remind us to process this
            new case in here. So this is a safe way to do the same thing.
